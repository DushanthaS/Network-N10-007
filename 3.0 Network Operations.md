## 3.1 Given a scenario, use appropriate documentation and diagrams to manage the network.
[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/Q5wv592XxlE)

- Diagram symbols: 
  - Pictures depicting routers, switches, firewalls, etc. in a network diagram. In
diagrams, routers are typically depicted as circles and switches are depicted as triangles.
- Standard operating procedures/work instructions: 
  - This document shows who can/cannot access
server rooms, network policy and procedures such as network firewalls, passwords, physical
security, protocols, mobile device use, and etc.
- Logical vs. physical diagrams:
  - Logical: A high level diagram that shows how data flows in a network, for planning and collaboration
  - Physical: A diagram that shows how a network is physically connected showing
information such as: IP addressing, cabling info, servers, network devices, WAN, user info, and etc.
- Rack diagrams: 
  - Diagram that shows where cables go to and their purpose on a rack.
- Change management documentation: 
  - A set of documents that defines procedures for changes. 
  - Such as upgrade software, change firewall config, switch ports
  - Have clear policies covering, frequency, duration, installation process, fallback procedure
to the network.
- Wiring and port locations: 
  - Diagram that shows where wires/ports are set on a network. The
more general this is written, the less updating is required when changes occur.
- IDF (Intermediate Distribution Frame)/MDF (Main Distribution Frame) documentation:
  - Termination point within local telephone exchange where equipment and local loopbacks are
connected by jumper wires. Must document all free-standing or wall-mounted rack and the
cables running between them and the end users so technicians can easily refer to it.
- Labeling: 
  - The process of labeling items/devices. Should have standard rules that are enforced at
all levels in the organization.
- Network configuration and performance baselines: 
  - Document that shows how a network should
normally operate: typical network usage, speeds, and etc.
- Inventory management: 
  - Process of tagging and recording all assets.
  - A record of every asset, routers , switches , etc
  - Financial records , audits , depreciation - make/model , config, purchase date
  - Tag the asset, barcode , RFID etc.

## 3.2 Compare and contrast business continuity and disaster recovery concepts.

### 3.2.1 Availability concepts:

[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/g36k1zgYuu4)
- Fault tolerance: 
  - The ability for a system to respond to unexpected failures or system
crashes as the backup system immediately and automatically takes over with no loss of
service.
    - Single device FT - RAID, redundant power supply UPS
    - Multiple device FT - server farms with load balancing , multiple network paths, clustering 
- High availability: 
  - When a system is continuously operational at all times.
  - HA almost always mean higher costs 
- Load balancing: 
  - Distributing a computing or networking workload across multiple
systems to avoid congestion and slow performance.
- NIC (Network Interface Controller) teaming: 
  - A type of link aggregation in which two or more NICs work in tandem to handle traffic to and from a single node.
  - AKA Load balancing/ fail over (LBFO)
    - Aggregate bandwidth (multiple networks), redundant paths (problem with one path, no problem)
    - Multiple network adapters, looks like a single adapter
    - NICs talk to each other , usually multicast instead of broadcast 
    - Fails over when NIC doesn't respond
- Port aggregation: 
  - Is a mechanism for aggregating ports together for increasing bandwidth between switches
  - Switch connected to the server has redundant connections to multiple NICs (both pots as single aggregated connection)
  - To add fault tolerance, you can even have multiple switches with different connections
- Clustering: 
  - Provides failover, load balancing, and high availability for the services
running on the cluster.
24
- Power management: [Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/ujhX3iSJXD8)
  - The ability to place computers and devices in low-power states
when they are not being used.
  - Battery backups/UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply): 
    - A device that provides backup power when the electrical power fails or drops to an unacceptable voltage level.
  - Power generators: 
    - Supply power during a power outage. Power generators consist of
  three major components: fuel, an engine, and a generator. The engine burns the fuel to
  turn the generator and create power. The three common sources of fuel are natural gas,
  gasoline, and diesel. Diesel fuel generators are the most common type of generator
  supplying data centers around the world.
  - Dual power supplies: 
    - Power generators and battery UPSs are a requirement to operate during a power outage.
    - Each power supply can handle 100% of the load but would normally run at 50%
    - Hot swappable, replace the faulty PS without powering down.

  - Redundant circuits: 
    - Redundant Circuit Pair means two identical power circuits installed
  in the same cabinet or rack, neither of which is a part of another pair of circuits in the
  same cabinet or rack.
### 3.2.2 Recovery:
[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/8Y-ykV42R_M)

- Cold sites: 
  - A "recovery" cold site is essentially data center space, with power, and
network connectivity that is available when needed. In the event of a disaster, teams
can move and install a business's hardware at the cold site in order to get the systems
back up and running.
- Warm sites: 
  - A "preventative" warm site allows a business to pre-install hardware and
pre-configure their bandwidth needs. In the event of a disaster, the business can then
load their software and restore their business systems/ data.
- Hot sites: 
  - A "proactive" hot site allows a business to keep servers and a live backup site
up and running in the event of a disaster. The production environment is replicated in a
data center, allowing for immediate access in the event of a disaster at the primary site.
- Backups: [Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/68hbHE6Zk4g)
  - Procedures that store company data files in a safe place, such as online or on a
flash drive.
    - Full: A backup that copies all data to the archive medium.
    - Differential: A type of partial backup that involves copying all changes made since the
    last full backup. Thus, each new differential backup file contains the cumulative effects
    of all activity since the last full backup.
    - Incremental: A type of partial backup that involves copying only the data items that
    have changed since the last partial backup. This produces a set of incremental backup
    files, each containing the results of one day's transactions
- Snapshots: 
  - Technology that is very flexible, allowing making different types of
momentary copies of volumes or file systems
  - Snapshots can capture the currant config and data, revert to known state
### 3.2.3 MTTR (Mean Time To Repair): 
- The average length of time required to perform a repair on the
device
### 3.2.4 MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures): 
- A measure of the average time between failures in a
system - the higher the amount, the more reliable the thing is.
### 3.2.5 SLA requirements (Service Level Agreement): 
- A legally binding contract or part of a contract that
defines, in plain language and in measurable terms, the aspects of a service provided to a
25
customer. Specific details might include contract duration, guaranteed uptime, problem
management, performance benchmarks, and termination options.



## 3.3 Explain common scanning, monitoring and patching processes and summarize their expected outputs.
[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/ThXm2qbFIH8)
### 3.3.1 Processes:
- Log reviewing: 
  - Process for looking at event logs to find intrusions and diagnosing current
system problems. You need a lot of memory space to store logs, use data rollup when
necessary.
  - Data rollup - take sample every minute, keep 5 min samples for 30 days, after 30 days rollup to 1hr sample time
  - Data graphing - many different sources of data, raw logs and summarized matadata show as a graph, usually managed by through a SIEM 
- Port scanning: 
  - Using a program to remotely determine which ports on a system are open.
  - Nmap - network mapper 
    - Find devices and identify open ports
    - discover OS without logging to a device, 
    - identify available services, name , version 
    - vulnerability scans with additional scripts
- Vulnerability scanning: 
  - The act of scanning for weaknesses and susceptibilities in the network and on individual systems.
  - Unlike pentest, minimally invasive, poke arround and see whats open, identify systems and security devices
  - Vulnerability scan reports
    - Lack of security controlls such as firewalls , AV
    - Misconfigs, open shares, guest access
    - New and old known vulnerabilities
- Patch management: 
  - The process of regularly applying patches and updates to software.
  
- Rollback: 
  - Undo any changes made to a system if the update that was recently installed negatively affects it.
- Reviewing baselines: 
  - Concept of understanding what normal operation of your network looks like over time.
- Packet/traffic analysis: 
  - Concept of gathering information from packets and traffic patterns on the network. Use this to identify unknown traffic or verify packet filtering and security controls.
### 3.3.2 Event management:

[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/DjDfL3ic5Qo)

- Notifications: 
  - Getting alerted to an event occurring by sending an alert via SMS text or
Email to the administrator.
- Alerts: 
  - Set alerts for when important events occur that need immediate addressing.
- SIEM (Security Information and Event Management): 
  - Provide notifications and real-time
  - Log aggregation and long term storage 
  - Data correlation , link diverse data types
  - Forensic analysis
analysis of security alerts and can help you head off problems quickly.
### 3.3.3 SNMP (Simple Network Messaging Protocol) monitors: 
- Is any kind of software that proactively quarry workstations and devices on a network
- MIB (Management Information Base): 
  - A database used in network management that
contains a device's definitions of managed objects and their data.
- SNMP v3 is the standard version that provide MSG integrity, authentication, encryption
### 3.3.4 Metrics:
[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/7jBtOw1-3ow)
-  Error rate: The amount of packets per second that error out. (CRC error, runt, giant)
- Utilization: Is how much bandwidth of a port is being used. (per interface network usage, run bandwidth tests to view throughput)
- Packet drops: The amount of packets dropped per second
- Bandwidth/throughput: The amount of data that can be transferred in a given time
period.


## 3.4 Given a scenario, use remote access methods.
[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/34ldGdtlvmk)
### 3.4.1 VPN (Virtual Private Network): 
- A network that uses a public telecommunication infrastructure,
such as the Internet, to provide remote offices or individual users with secure access to their
organization's network
  - IPSec (Internet Protocol Security): 
    - A Layer 3 protocol that defines encryption, authentication, and key management for TCP/IP transmissions. 
    - Confidentiality and integrity / anti replay- encryption and packet signing
    - IPSec is an enhancement to IPv4 and is native to IPv6. IPSec is unique among authentication methods in that it adds security information to the header of all IP packets.
    - Two core IPSec protocols
      - Authentication header (AH)
      - Encapsulation security payload (ESP)
  - SSL/TLS
    - SSL (Secure Socket Layer): 
      - Protocol for web browsers and servers that allows for the authentication, encryption and decryption of data sent over the Internet.

    - TLS (Transport Layer Security): 
      - Replaced SSL. It is a security protocol that uses
      certificates and public key cryptography for mutual authentication and data
      encryption over a TCP/IP connection.
      - Uses common SSL/TLS protocol (tcp/443)
      - No need of lots of resources, supported by many firewalls 
      - No requirements like digital certificates or shared passwords like in IPSec, use regular UN/PW
      - Can be run from browser or light VPN client 
  - DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security): 
    - Is based on the TLS protocol and provides the same security TLS provides. DTLS is mainly used for UDP encryption of segments and datagrams.
    - Good choice for streaming or Voip
  - Site-to-site: 
    - This VPN type connects one entire network site to another; such as a headquarters location to a branch office.
    - Common implementation of IPSec, and VPN Appliance in both sides 

  - Client-to-site/ remote access VPN: 
    - Connections are used to connect an individual device, such as a laptop or mobile phone, to the company network.
    - Common config for SSL/TLS VPN
    - Need a software on the user device, that will connect to a VPN Concentrator 
### 3.4.2 RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol): 
 - Allows the user to access a remote system as if they were sitting in front of it in the remote location.
### 3.4.3 SSH (Secure Shell): 
- Protocol used for encrypted console communication. An SSH connection is secure at both ends of the connection.
### 3.4.4 VNC (Virtual Network Computing): 
- An open source system that enables a remote workstation to manipulate and receive screen updates from a host.
### 3.4.5 Telnet: 
- An unsecure protocol used for console communication.
### 3.4.6 HTTPS/management URL: 
- Manage devices from an encrypted web based front end 
### 3.4.7 Remote file access:
- FTP/FTPS:
  - FTP (File Transport Protocol): 
    - Transfers files between systems with authentication but no built in encryption.
  - FTPS (File Transport Protocol Security): FTP-SSL
   - Is an extension to FTP that adds support for the TLS.
- SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol): 
   - Provides file system functionality over SSH. 
   - Used for resuming interrupted transfers, directory listing, and remote file removal.
- TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol): 
  - Has no authentication. May be used to download
configurations for devices such as VoIP phones.
### 3.4.8 Out-of-band management:
- The network isnt available or device isnt accessible from the network, Out-of-band management is a way to manage these devices without network availability
- Modem: 
  - Connect a modem and dial-in to manage the device when the network is not
available or if the device is not accessible from the network. (just like connecting to a comm port but from remote)
- Console router: 
  - Gives out-of-band access for multiple devices when the network is not
available or if the device is not accessible from the network.


## 3.5 Identify policies and best practices.

[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/D5ukHdq_JOk)
- Privileged user agreement: 
  - A signed agreement to only use privileged access only for assigned job duties.
- Password policy: 
  - A collection of settings to control password characteristics such as length, complexity, how often it should be changed.
- On-boarding/off-boarding procedures:
  - On-boarding: Procedure for new hires in organization. IT agreements need to be signed,
  create accounts and associate users with proper groups, rights/access files, and departs,
  and provide required IT software.
  - Off-boarding: Procedure for out-going employees in an organization. Should be
  preplanned on how to handle the hardware, data. Account information is usually
  deactivated, not always deleted.
- Licensing restrictions: 
  - Policy that only grants licenses to authorized users. Make sure licenses are
always available and not expired.
- International export controls: 
  - U.S. laws and regulations that restrict the release of critical
technologies and information to foreign nationals, within and outside of the United States, for
reasons of foreign policy and to ensure national security.
   - Dual use (software that can use for both civilian and military) software can be controlled 
- Data loss prevention: 
  - Policies that dictate how an organization handles personally identifiable
data such as medical records. Details how the sensitive data is: transferred and encrypted.
- Remote access policies: 
  - Policies that define how to manage data and process of communication
outside of the network. Sets specific technical requirements such as encrypted connection,
confidential credentials, use of network, and hardware and software requirements.
- Incident response policies: 
  - Policies on how to respond to security attacks. Shows how an
incident is defined, how the incident is organized, and who responds to the incident.
- BYOD (Bring Your Own Device): 
  - The practice of allowing users to use their own personal devices
to connect to an organizational network. Difficult to secure.
- AUP (Acceptable Use Policy): 
  - A Set of rules and guidelines that are set up to regulate Internet
use as well as what employees can perform on company equipment.
- NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement): 
  - A signed agreement between a company and an agency in
which the agency promises they will not disclose or share confidential information.
- System life cycle:
  - Asset disposal: Some information must not be destroyed, consider offsite storage. Wipe
devices completely to prevent dumpster diving, or physically destroy it.
- Safety procedures and policies: 
  - Policies on equipment safety, personal safety, handling of toxic
waste, local government regulations, and environmental regulations.
