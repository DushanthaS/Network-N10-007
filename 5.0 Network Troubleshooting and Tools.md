### 5.1.1 Identify the problem: Effective troubleshooting begins with a clear problem definition.
- Gather information.
- Duplicate the problem, if possible.
- Question users.
- Identify symptoms.
- Determine if anything has changed.
- Approach multiple problems individually.
### 5.1.2 Establish a theory of probable cause: 
- This is the point in the troubleshooting process where your
experience and intuition can be extremely helpful because you are now going to brainstorm a
list of possible causes.
- Question the obvious.
  - Consider multiple approaches.
  - Top-to-bottom/bottom-to-top.
  - OSI model.
  - Divide and conquer.
### 5.1.3 Test the theory to determine the cause: 
- Before taking action on what you consider to be the
most likely cause of a problem, do a sanity check on your theory.
  - Once the theory is confirmed, determine the next steps to resolve the problem.
  - If the theory is not confirmed, reestablish a new theory or escalate.
### 5.1.4 Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and identify potential effects: 
- You may determine that you could fix the problem right away, but doing so might require excessive
network down-time. 
- Down-time costs organizations money and is usually unacceptable.
### 5.1.5 Implement the solution or escalate as necessary: 
- Once done, don't automatically assume that
the system will work properly. You should implement a series of tests to verify full system
functionality.
### 5.1.6 Verify full system functionality and, if applicable, implement preventive measures.
### 5.1.7 Document findings, actions, and outcomes.


## 5.2 Given a scenario, use the appropriate tool.

- Attenuation: 
  - Loss of power/intensity in a signal as it travels from the sending device to the receiving device.
  - signal strength ratio measurements can be done using dB
  - dB loss symptoms
    - No signal, or intermittent connectivity, poor performance (signal too weak, CRC errors , Data corruption)
    - TDR/OTDR will help you with this 
- Latency: 
  - Is the measurement of time for data traveling from the source host to the destination
host. 
  - Latency for network connections is measured in millionths of a second, called milliseconds.
  - Packet captures and protocol analyzers can help to get an idea with microsecond granularity
- Jitter: 
  - A delay in completing a transmission of all the frames in a message; caused by excessive machines on a network.
  - Data should arrive at regular intervals if not jitter happens
  - If you miss a packet , theres no retransmission (voice , live video)
  - Troubleshooting excessive Jitter
    - Confirm available bandwidth
    - Make sure the infrastructure is working as expected , check queues in your switches and routers, no dropped frames

- Crosstalk: XT
  - Occurs when a signal travels no on one wire or cable infringes on the signal traveling over an adjacent wire or cable.
  - Measure XT with `TDR` time domain reflectometer 
  - Near end crosstalk NEXT - interference measured at the transmitting end 
  - Far end crosstalk (FEXT) interference measured away from the transmitter
  - Troubleshooting Crosstalk
    - Mostly wiring issues - check your crimp at the end of the cable
    - Maintain the twist - twist helps to avoid crosstalk
    - use sheailded cables or CAT 6A increase cable diameter - increase the distance between pairs 
    - Test and certify the installation
- EMI (Electromagnetic Interference): 
  - A type of interference that may be caused by motors, power lines, televisions, copiers, fluorescent lights, or other sources of electrical activity.
  - Measure EMI with `TDR` time domain reflectometer 
  - Cable handling - no twisting , watch the bend radius
- Open/short:
    - Open: One end of the cable doesn't connect. Diagnose cable, if bad then replace.
    - Short: One or more of the wires in a cable connect to another wire in the cable. If bad
    then replace.
    - Advanced troubleshooting with `TDR`
- Incorrect pin-out: 
  - The twisted pair wires are not all correctly aligned on both ends of the cable.
  - Use a `cable tester` to verify that that was the issue with the cable.
  - Check cable termination with T568A/B miss match
- Incorrect cable type: 
  - The Ethernet cabling used to connect to the network are all rated according to the specification they support. 
  - It is important to look at the cable sheath for the specification it supports. A Cat5 cable on a Cat 6 network will not perform as expected. 
  - Make sure cable specs match with whats shown on TDR
- Bad port: 
  - When diagnosing a connection issue, always check the network adapter for the
connection LED status indicators, technicians can use a loopback plug to diagnose a bad port or
failed adapter. It is possible that the port has bent pins creating intermittent connections or no
connection at all.

- Troubleshooting Interfaces 
  - Interface errors - many indicate bad cable or hardware problem
  - Verify config - speed , duplex, VLAN
  - Verify two way traffic, end to end connectivity
- Transceiver mismatch: 
  - Is not common with Ethernet transceivers because most transceivers
auto-negotiate speed and duplex. 
  - Most 10 Gbps transceivers are not backward compatible with lower data rates, and some 1 Gbps transceivers are not compatible with lower data rates as well.
  - Transceivers have to match the fiber - single mode transceiver connects to single mode fiber
  - Signal loss, dropped frames, missing frames

- TX/RX reverse: 
  - Is when Transmit and the Receive pairs of a cable are inverted so the TX sides are connected to each other and the RX sides are connected to each other (as opposed to the correct way of connecting TX to RX).
  - No connectivity - auto MDIX might connect , try turning that on 
  - Locate reversal location, often at a punchdown, check the patch panel 

- Duplex/speed mismatch: 
  - When two devices connected by Ethernet do not properly negotiate
their connection.
  - Duplex: 
    - Duplex mismatch occurs when the two communicating Ethernet devices end up
    with duplex settings that are not the same, either because of manual settings or the
    auto-negotiation process. 
    - Two devices with a duplex mismatch will communicate , but reduced speed, this will also increase in late collisions. 


  - Speed miss match : the two devices with a speed mismatch, must be identical , many switch configs will auto negotiate the speed 
    - Less than expected throughput
- Damaged cables: 
  - Cables that are run through walls or overhead are not usually subject to damage. However, you will find some cabling run under a floor mat or rug. 
  - This subjects the cable to foot traffic that can eventually damage the cable. Some cables can be pinched between the desk and a wall which will cause damage over time.
  - Check your physical layer - cables should not bent or folded , check the bent pins
  - Check your TDR, replace the cable 
- Bent pins: 
  - Over time these can wear down from use. The connectors get bent over time. Try
plugging into another device to see if it is still an issue

- Bottlenecks: 
  - Often occur when network traffic or a process slows down at a specific point. The specific point will not have the same capacity as the network traffic or process and is restricted in some way.
  - Theres never just one performance metric, I/O bus, CPU speed , storage access speed , network throughput etc. 
  - 
- VLAN mismatch: 
  - A switch will be configured to support one pre-configured default VLAN containing all switch ports which cannot be renamed or deleted and additional native VLAN(s) that should be renamed for security. 
  - When configuring native VLANS remember that both ends must match the VLAN assignment or a VLAN mismatch will occur.
  - Check the switch config, each port should have VLAN setting, VLAN 1 is usually the default
- Network connection LED status indicators:
  - No light no connection, might be a cabling or interface config issue
  - Link light shows switch is connected but cant surf web, - DHCP IP may not be on the correct subnet 
  
## 5.4 Given a scenario, troubleshoot common wireless connectivity and performance issues.
- Reflection: 
  - Is when a wireless signal bounces off an object and weakens the signal. To prevent this, remove any metal materials that could be causing it.
  - Too much reflection can weaken the signal, a little multipath interference can actually help with MIMO
  - Position the antennas to avoid excessive reflection 

- Refraction: 
  - Is when a signal passes through an object and exists at a different angle. The presence of glass or water (especially during weather) can cause this.
  - Data rates are affected , signal is less directional 
- Absorption: 
  - Is when a signal passes through an object and loses some of the signal as it passes through. Things like walls and ceilings can absorb the signal.
  - 2.4 GHz signal has less absorption than 5 GHz
  - Put the antennas on the ceiling, avoid going through walls 
- Latency: 
  - The delay between the transmission of a signal and its recipient.
- Jitter: 
  - Deviation from a predictable data stream
- Attenuation: 
  - Is the loss of signal from an access point to a receiving device. You can fix this by boosting the signal strength on the access point or by moving closer to the AP.
  - The attenuation can be measured with a WIFI analyzer 
  - Control the power output of the AP / use a receive antenna with a higher gain
- Incorrect antenna type: 
  - Omnidirectional antennas are best used on ceilings to service a single
building. Directional antennas are best used to connect to buildings together
- Interference: 
  - Is when something else is trying to use the same frequency. Examples of devices that can cause interference: cordless phones, microwave ovens, and fluorescent lights.
  - unpredictable interference - multi tenant building 
  - Measure using `netstat -e` mac/linux or performance monitor on win 
- Incorrect antenna placement: 
  - Antennas too close will cause overlapping, too far apart will cause
slow throughput.
- Channel overlap: 
  - Is when multiple channels share the frequency band causing interference and
performance degradation for devices operating on channels that are too close to each other.
- Overcapacity: 
  - With wireless networks there's only so much capacity available. Only so many
devices can be communicating over these very narrow frequency ranges that we have for
wireless networks. If you have too many devices on the same wireless network, the network
performance will begin to degrade.
- Distance limitations: 
  - If the distance limitations for a given network media are exceeded,
transmissions over that media are degraded to the point where the receiving device is unable to
properly interpret the transmission.
- Frequency mismatch: 
  - Devices must match the access point. Verify the client is communicating
over the correct channel. This is normally done automatically and may cause issues if done
manually.
- Wrong SSID (Security Set Identifier): 
  - When configuring a wireless client, you must be sure that
you are accessing the correct SSID. The SSID will not be visible unless it is broadcasted.

- Wrong passphrase: 
  - Once you have the correct configuration you can attempt to connect. Your
next challenge is using the correct Password/passphrase for authentication. A wrong passphrase
will be denied.
- Security type mismatch: 
  - Wireless signals are transmitted openly making them subject to interception. The signals are encrypted to secure communications. Early encryption types like WEP and WPA are insecure and your network should use at least WPA2. If the client security is set to something other than that of the access point it will not connect to the network.
- Power levels: 
  - If the power level is too low, mobile devices further away may not receive a
signal. On some access points, radio power can be increased to expand the coverage area. In
situations where your signals reach outside the intended area, you can decrease the radio
power.
- Signal-to-noise ratio: 
  - Devices in your networking environment produce EMI. The aggregate of this EMI is the noise floor. If your signal is too close to the noise floor you risk corrupted data and the retransmissions created by this corruption.
## 5.5 Given a scenario, troubleshoot common network service issues.
[xxx](https://youtu.be/OzltYOATxIE)
- Names not resolving: 
  - When you have an issue where a statically configured client cannot access
the internet try to ping a publicly available resource like google.com by its IP address 8.8.8.8. If
you can connect to the server with the IP address try its URL (www.whatyouaretrying.com). If
the resource cannot be located by its domain name, you should check the static DNS settings for
misconfiguration.
- Incorrect gateway: 
  - Your gateway directly affects internet connectivity. Using the incorrect
gateway will limit your connections to the local network.
- Incorrect netmask: 
  - A computer's netmask identifies the number of bits of its IP address that are
assigned to the network and those bits assigned to the host. An incorrect configuration will
result in limited connectivity or no connectivity at all.
- Duplicate IP addresses: 
  - No two devices can have the same IP address on public or private networks. Address duplication is prevented by using DHCP. 
  - When an address is static it is possible to assign the same IP configuration to two devices.
  - Multiple DHCP servers/ rogue DHCP servers 
  - Symptoms  - intermittent connectivity 
- Duplicate MAC addresses: 
  - The hardware address of your interface is assigned by the manufacturer and is unique. Duplicate MAC addresses will not communicate on a LAN. This address can be changed and possibly misconfigured manually through software.
  - Symptoms  - intermittent connectivity , confirm with a packet capture, should see ARP contention
- Expired IP address: 
  - Your device using DHCP negotiates a lease for an IP address from the DHCP server. The lease time is set by the administrator. The lease times should be tailored to your usage. The lease lengths should be long enough to support your usage without causing an exhausted DHCP scope.
  - Check the status of your DHCP server 
- Rogue DHCP server: 
  - Unusual internet/internetwork traffic should be reported immediately. This misdirection can be attributed to a rogue DHCP server. The rogue server can provide compromised DHCP settings and can use these settings to further compromise your network.
- Untrusted SSL certificate: 
  - SSL certificates must be maintained and accurate. An SSL certificate can become untrusted in several ways. It can expire. It could be using an incorrect date or time. It can also be revoked for a mismatch between the server name on the certificate and the actual server. These issues can be significantly reduced by not allowing self-signed certificates (certificates signed by the user).
  - Add company's CA to your browser 
- Incorrect time: 
  - Device time synchronization is supported by the NTP protocol on your network. NTP servers can be on your local network or the internet. In the absence of a reliable NTP server, the device's internal clock is used. The internal clock is powered by the CMOS battery which could be the source of the problem.
  - Kerberos communication uses a timestamp , time sensitive , client cant login 
- Exhausted DHCP scope: 
  - Is when a DHCP scope has run out of addresses to lease. Clients will assign an APIPA address (local subnet only)
  - If possible add more IP addresses to the address pool. IPAM (IP Address Management) will help monitor and report IP address shortages. 
  - Lower lease time - allow more IPs to released faster 
- Blocked TCP/UDP ports: 
  - Cause necessary applications to not work or slow down. Could be caused by a Firewall or ACL configuration. Confirm the issue with a packet capture. If you receive no response to requests, run a TCP- or UDP-based traceroute tool to see how far the packets go.
- Incorrect host-based firewall settings: 
  - Cause necessary applications to not work or not be accessible. Based on the application in use and not necessarily the protocol and port. Check the host-based firewall settings.
- Incorrect ACL settings: 
  - Causes only certain IP addresses accessible or all IP addresses to be blocked. Confirm with packet captures and TCP/UDP traceroutes to identify the point of no return.
- Unresponsive service: 
  - Is when there is no response to an application request. Ensure that it is the correct application, port, and protocol (TCP/UDP). When there is an unresponsive service, an administrator who can respond/resolve may need to be contacted.
- Hardware failure: 
  - To properly diagnose a hardware failure, follow the best practices for troubleshooting. Once a failed device is identified it should be replaced. All critical devices should have failover capabilities or a compatible and preconfigured hardware replacement.
