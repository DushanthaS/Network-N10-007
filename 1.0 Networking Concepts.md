### 1.1.2 Protocol types
[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/M5c9HdaQqh0)
- IP
  - The Internet Protocol (IP) is a network layer protocol that allows for the logical addressing of networks and hosts. 
  - The addressing of networks is the mechanism that allows routing to be used. The addressing of the hosts within the networks is the mechanism that allows end-to-end connectivity to be achieved over the network.
  - The UDP and TCP protocols function on top of the IP protocol. UDP and TCP are protocols that handle the data for the applications. The IP protocol is responsible for encapsulating these protocols and delivering it to the appropriate addresses
  - [IP packet header](Images/IP-packet.jpg)
    - The first 4 bits contains the version of IP; this is how IPv4 and IPv6 packets are differentiated. 
    - The priority and type of service (ToS) fields are used for quality of service (QoS)
    - The time to live (TTL) field is used for routing so that packets are not endlessly routed on the Internet. 
    - The protocol field defines where to send the data next—UDP, TCP, ICMP, and so on.
    - Source and destination IP address fields for routing to the destination computer and responding of the destination computer. 
  - TCP and UDP are Encapsulated by the IP protocol
    - They are OSI Layer 4
    - Use many different applications at the same time (Multiplexing)


- TCP Transmission Control Protocol
   -  Connection-oriented
      -  A formal connection setup and close
   -  “Reliable” delivery
      -  Recovery from errors
      -  Can manage out-of-order messages or retransmissions
   -  Flow control
      -  The receiver can manage how much data is sent

- How TCP Works
  - When TCP wants to open a connection with another host, it follows this procedure:
  - 1. It sends a message called a SYN to the target host.

  - 2. The target host opens a connection for the request and sends back an acknowledgment message called an ACK (or SYN ACK).

  - 3. The host that originated the request sends back another acknowledgment, saying that it has received the ACK message and that the session is ready to be used to transfer data.

  - When the data session is completed, a similar process is used to close the session. This three-step session establishment and acknowledgment process is called the TCP three-way handshake.”


- UDP User Datagram Protocol
  
   -  Connectionless
      -  No formal open or close to the connection
   -  “Unreliable” delivery - No error recovery
      -  No reordering of data or retransmissions
   -  No flow control
      -  Sender determines the amount of data transmitted
      -  Unlike TCP, with UDP no session is established between the sending and receiving hosts, which is why UDP is called a connectionless protocol. The upshot of this is that UDP has much lower overhead than TCP. 


- ICMP
   -  Internet Control Message Protocol used by IP
      -  “Text messaging” for your network devices
   -  Another protocol carried by IP - Not used for data transfer
   -  Devices can request and reply to administrative requests
      -  Hey, are you there? / Yes, I’m right here.
   -  Devices can send messages when things don’t go well
      -  That network you’re trying to reach is not reachable from here
      -  Your time-to-live expired, just letting you know
### 1.1.3  Connection-oriented vs. connectionless

## 1.2 Explain devices, applications, protocols and services at their appropriate OSI layers.

 -  Layer 1 – Physical
    -  The physics of the network
       -  Signaling, cabling, connectors
       -  This layer isn’t about protocols
    -  You have a physical layer problem.”
       -  Fix your cabling, punch-downs, etc.
       -  Run loopback tests, test/replace cables,
   swap adapter cards
 -  Layer 2 – Data link

    -  The basic network “language”
       -  The foundation of communication
   at the data link layer
    -  Data Link Control (DLC) protocols
       -  MAC (Media Access Control) address on Ethernet
    -  The “switching” layer
 -  Layer 3 – Network
    -  The “routing” layer
    -  Internet Protocol (IP)
    -  Fragments frames to traverse different networks
    - What is IP Fragmentation?
      -  Fragments are always in multiples of 8 because of the
   number of fragmentation offset bits in the IP header
 -  Layer 4 – Transport
    -  The “post office” layer
       -  Parcels and letters
    -  TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and
   UDP (UserDatagram Protocol)
 -  Layer 5 – Session

    -  Communication management between devices
       -  Start, stop, restart
    -  Half-duplex, full-duplex
    -  Control protocols, tunneling protocols
 -  Layer 6 – Presentation
    -  Character encoding
    -  Application encryption
    -  Often combined with the Application Layer

 -  Layer 7 – Application
    -  The layer we see - HTTP, FTP, DNS, POP3
## 1.3 Explain the concepts and characteristics of routing and switching.

 ###  1.3.1 Properties of network traffic
 - Broadcast domains

[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/SGbtLjIEVeo)

    - The broadcast domain is defined as a group of devices on a network segment that hear all broadcasts transmitted on the network segment. 
    - These broadcasts are generally layer 2 broadcasts.
    - Excessive broadcast traffic in a network can create congestion for unicast network traffic. 
    - Some broadcast traffic in a network is considered a healthy portion of traffic. We can’t totally get rid of broadcast traffic because many supporting protocols rely on it. 
    - As your network grows, the broadcast traffic required to support it also increases. 
    - To combat congestion that can be caused by broadcasts, we can simply create more broadcast domains and limit the number of devices affected. 
    - As we increase the number of broadcast domains, we reduce the number of computers affected by the broadcasts in each domain. 
    - This is commonly done by creating additional network segments and connecting the segments together with a router, because routers stop broadcasts. 


- CSMA/CD
- [Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/iXfBbs9SSFQ)
    - Carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) is a wired Ethernet contention method. 
    - CSMA allows the network controller to sense a carrier to transmit data. CSMA also provides a path for multiple computers to talk or have access to the same network.
   -  CS - Carrier Sense
      -  Is there a carrier? Is anyone communicating? (ethernet adapter listen if theres a carrier )
   -  MA - Multiple Access
      -  More than one device on the network
   -  CD - Collision Detect
      -  Collision - Two stations talking at once
      -  Identify when data gets garbled
      -  Half-duplex Ethernet - not used any longer
   
   -  CSMA/CD operation
      -  Listen for an opening
         -  Don’t transmit if the network is already busy
      -  Send a frame of data
         -  You send data whenever you can
         -  There’s no queue or prioritization
      -  If a collision occurs
         -  Transmit a jam signal to let everyone know a collision has occurred
         -  Wait a random amount of time, then retry


- CSMA/CA (for wireless networks)
    -  CA - Collision Avoidance
       -  Common on wireless networks
    -  Collision detection isn’t possible
       -  A sending station can’t “hear” other stations
    -  Common to see RTS/CTS Ready to send/ clear to send
        -  I’m ready! You’re clear! (when AP give CTS only that device can send during that time)
        -  Solves the “hidden node” problem
           -  Station A can hear the access point
           -  Station B can hear the access point
           -  Station A can’t hear station B

- Collision domains
[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/SGbtLjIEVeo)


  - A collision will occur when two nodes send a frame simultaneously on the same physical network or media. 
  - The key concept is that frame collisions happen at the physical layer. 
  - Collisions are common on networks that use hubs, because hubs communicate using half-duplex Ethernet. 
  - The same pair of wires used to transmit data is the same pair of wires used to receive data. 
  - Therefore, data could possibly be transmitted on the same pair simultaneously by two nodes, thus causing a collision.
  - When a collision occurs, all the nodes on the physical network must stop and wait for a random period of time via the CSMA/CD contention method. 
  - No data can be transmitted during this wait time. This wait time means that bandwidth is reduced as more collisions occur. 
  - A typical 10 Mbps connection with only two or three computers may be able to sustain a top speed of only 6 or 7 Mbps, due to collisions.
  - The best way to solve collisions is to replace all hubs with switches and verify full-duplex Ethernet connectivity. 

- Protocol data units PDU[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/3RQW9s-aB6k)
  - Protocol data units (PDUs) is how we describe the type of data transferred at each layer of the OSI model. 
  - The layers of the OSI and their corresponding PDU can be seen in this [Figure](Images/pdu.jpg). 
  - The first three layers of the OSI (application, presentation, and session) reference the components of an application. 
  - The PDU is considered user datagrams, or just datagrams. The datagrams are created by the application and passed to the transport layer. 
  - The transport layer is where segments are created from the datagrams, and then the segment is passed to the network layer. 
  - At the network layer, packets are created from the segments and the packet is passed to the data link layer. 
  - The data link layer creates frames for transmitting the data in bits at the physical layer.  
  
- MTU The maximum transmission unit
  - The maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the largest size of the data that can be transferred at the data link layer. 
  - The MTU for Ethernet is 1500 bytes. [Figure](Images/ethernet-ii-hdr-n-fields.jpg) Including 12 bytes for the destination and source MAC address, a 2-byte type field, and 4 bytes for the frame checking sequence (FCS) brings the MTU to 1518 bytes. 
  - The smallest MTU is 46 bytes, or 64 bytes if including the frame fields.The MTU is often referred to as a layer 3 data size. When data is passed down to the data link layer, the packet is sized to the MTU of the data link layer. 
  - Therefore, we can consider the MTU a constraint on the network layer. However, it is usually adjustable only at the data link layer, such as when you’re configuring a switch port on a switch.
  - Troubleshooting MTU
     -  MTU sizes are usually configured once
     -  Based on the network infrastructure
    and don’t change often
     -  A significant concern for tunneled traffic
     -  The tunnel may be smaller than your local Ethernet segment
     -  What if you send packets with Don’t Fragment (DF) set?
     -  Routers will respond back and tell you to fragment
     -  Hope you get the ICMP message!
     -  Troubleshoot using ping
     -  Ping with DF and force a maximum size of 1472 bytes 
        -  1500 bytes - 8 byte ICMP header 20 bytes IP address = 1472 bytes
     -  Windows: ping -f -l 1472 8.8.8.8
  

- Broadcast [Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/jotgabyT-uI)

   -  Send information to everyone at once
   -  One packet, received by everyone
   -  Limited scope - the broadcast domain
   -  Broadcasts are used for DHCP, ARP, and a multitude of other supporting protocols.
   -  Routing updates, ARP requests
   -  When the destination MAC address is FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF or all 1s, switches will forward the frame to all active network interfaces.
   -  When the destination IP address is all 1s (or in this case, 255.255.255.255), the broadcast is considered a network layer broadcast. The operating system at this point processes the data within the packet when a network layer broadcast is received.
   -  Not all data link layer broadcasts are forwarded to the network layer. Where a broadcast gets forwarded to next depends on the protocol type in the frame. It is safe to say that all network broadcasts are also data link layer broadcasts.
   -  Not used in IPv6 - focus on multicast
- Multicast

   -  Delivery of information to interested systems
   -  One to many
   -  Multicast is a smart type of broadcast controlled by the switch. Multicast traffic is delivered only to the devices participating in the multicast session. This multicast process helps reduce bandwidth usage for computers not participating in the multicast communications.
   -  Multimedia delivery, stock exchanges
   -  Very specialized
   -  Difficult to scale across large networks


- Unicast

   -  Unicast communications is a one-to-one conversation between two network devices. 
   -  Unicast communications should make up 95 to 98 percent of the bandwidth in a typical network.
   -  Send information between two systems
   -  Web surfing, file transfers
   -  Does not scale optimally for streaming media



###  1.3.2 Segmentation and interface properties
[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/9L4qDmvKPjQ)
- VLANs Virtual Local Area Networks
    -  A group of devices in the same broadcast domain
    -  Separated logically instead of physically
    -  VLANs help control broadcasts by creating logical segmentation (logical switches) inside a switching infrastructure; these are virtual switches. 
    -  When we create multiple logical segments inside the switch infrastructure, it allows the network to become scalable to thousands of hosts without repercussions for bandwidth from broadcasts. 
    -  VLANs also help provide flexibility to the daily maintenance of adding and moving clients within a job function.
- Trunking (802.1q) dot 1 Q trunk
  - When we need to extend a VLAN infrastructure past a single switch, we use trunking. Trunking allows the VLAN information to be prepended to the switched frame as it traverses the switches. 
  - When the adjacent switch receives this frame, the trunking information is stripped off and the frame is forwarded to the appropriate port(s).
  - There are two main trunking protocols that are used today in switching. One is Inter-Switch Link (ISL), which is proprietary to Cisco equipment. The other trunking protocol is 802.1Q, which is an IEEE standard that is compliant with all switching equipment, including Cisco. 
  - The 802.1Q trunking protocol is nothing more than a prepended VLAN header field on an Ethernet frame.
   -  VLAN IDs - 12 bits long, support 4,094 VLANs
      -  some switches support “Normal range” - 1 through 1005, “Extended range” - 1006 through 4094
      -  0 and 4,095 are reserved VLAN numbers, not be able to specify those 
   -  Before 802.1Q, there was ISL (Inter-Switch Link)
      -  ISL is no longer used; everyone now uses the 802.1Q standard

- Tagging and untagging ports

   - 802.1Q trunks tag packets with VLAN tagging information; these ports are considered to be tagging ports. 
   - Normal network clients don’t need to see the 802.1Q tagging information. For the most part, they never really know what VLAN they are in—it’s the switches’ job to put them in the respective VLAN.
   - When the frame leaves the PC, it is untagged as a normal Ethernet II frame. If the destination computer is on the far side switch, then it must traverse the 802.1Q trunk link. 
   - When it leaves this port, it receives the VLAN tagging information; therefore, the 802.1Q trunk port is considered a tagging port. When it is received on the adjacent switch, the tagging information is read and forwarded to the destination host. 
   - When the information comes back from the far side switch, it is again tagged as it leaves the far-side trunk port. It is then read by the adjacent switch and forwarded onto the respective VLAN/port. When it leaves the host port, the tagging information is removed; hence, this port is called an untagging port.
   - Cisco calls an untagging port an access port and a tagging port a trunk port.



- Port mirroring

   -  Examine a copy of the traffic  (capture packets with a packet analyzer)
      -  Cisco and many other vendors refer to port mirroring as the Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) feature, network tap
   -  No way to block (prevent) traffic
- Switching loops/spanning tree
[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/mLCpdsOZM9c)
  - Loop protection
     -  Connect two switches to each other
        -  They’ll send traffic back and forth forever
        -  There’s no “counting” mechanism at the MAC layer
     -  This is an easy way to bring down a network
        -  And somewhat difficult to troubleshoot
        -  Relatively easy to resolve
     -  IEEE standard 802.1D (spanning tree protocol / STP) to prevent loops in bridged (switched) networks (1990)

  - STP port states (if switch configured with spanning tree protocol )
     -  Blocking - Not forwarding to prevent a loop
     -  Listening - Not forwarding and cleaning the MAC table
     -  Learning - Not forwarding and adding to the MAC table
     -  Forwarding - Data passes through and is fully operational
     -  Disabled - Administrator has turned off the port

  - RSTP (802.1w)
       -  Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (802.1w)
          -  A much-needed updated of STP
          -  This is the latest standard
       -  Faster convergence
          -  From 30 to 50 seconds to 6 seconds
       -  Backwards-compatible with 802.1D STP
          -  You can mix both in your network
       -  Very similar process
          -  An update, not a wholesale change
- PoE and PoE+ (802.3af, 802.3at)

  - Powering devices
     -  Power provided on an Ethernet cable
     -  One wire for both network and electricity
     -  Phones, cameras, wireless access points
     -  Power provided at the switch
     -  Built-in power - Endspans
     -  In-line power injector - Midspans
     -  Power modes
     -  Mode A - Power on the data pairs
     -  Mode B - Power on the spare pairs

- PoE and POE+
   -  PoE: IEEE 802.3af-2003
      -  The original PoE specification
      -  Included in 802.3at
      -  Now part of 802.3-2012

- Screened subnet (previously known as DMZ)
   - The demilitarized zone (DMZ) is a physical or logical segmentation of a network that allows public access or external access to semi-internal resources. 
   - There are three main segments of a network in relation to security. The internal network segment is the innermost portion of your network; it contains your database servers, mailbox servers, and so on. 
   - The external network segment is where the Internet or public network connects. The network that is positioned between the external and internal segments is the DMZ—the segment where you would install a public web server or email server.
between the Internet and you
- MAC address table

  - The MAC address table is responsible for associating a MAC address or multiple MAC addresses with a physical port on the switch. The MAC address table is sometimes referred to as content-addressable memory (CAM).
- ARP table
  - The ARP table is a temporary table in memory to reduce ARP requests for IP address–to–MAC address mappings. When a packet is created at the network layer, it is passed down to the data link layer for framing. The source MAC address is known because it is the host the data was initiated on. However, the destination MAC address is unknown, so the ARP protocol is used to find the MAC address for the destination IP address.
 
 
 
 ### 1.3.3  Routing
   #### 1.3.3.1 Routing protocols (IPv4 and IPv6)

   [Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/9390huk39mU)
  - Dynamic routing protocols 
    -  Listen for subnet information from other routers
       -  Sent from router to router
    -  Provide subnet information to other routers
       -  Tell other routers what you know
    -  Determine the best path based on the gathered information
       -  Every routing protocol has its own way of doing this
    -  When network changes occur, update the available routes
       -  Different convergence process for every dynamic routing protocol

  - Which routing protocol to use?
    -  What exactly is a route?
       -  Is it based on the state of the link?
       -  Is it based on how far away it is?
    -  How does the protocol determine the best path?
       -  Some formula is applied to the criteria to create a metric
       -  Rank the routes from best to worst
    -  Recover after a change to the network
       -  Convergence time can vary widely between routing protocols
    -  Standard or proprietary protocol?
       -  OSPF and RIP are standards, some functions of EIGRP are Cisco proprietary

  - Distance-vector routing protocols
    - dynamic routing protocols that use a formula based on distance to determine the best route
    -  Information passed between routers contains routing tables
       -  How many “hops” away is another network?
       -  The deciding “vector” is the “distance” (10 hops is longer than 5 hops, speed between hops doesn't matter)
    -  Usually automatic
       -  Very little configuration
    -  Good for smaller networks
       -  Doesn’t scale well to very large networks
    -  RIP, RIPv2, EIGRP

  - Link-state routing protocols
    -  Information passed between routers is related to the current connectivity
       -  If it’s up, you can get there.
       -  If it’s down, you can’t.
    -  Consider the speed of the link
       -  Faster is always better, right?
    -  Very scalable
       -  Used most often in large networks
    -  OSPF - Large, scalable routing protocol
  - Hybrid
      -  A little link-state, a little distance-vector
         -  Not many examples of a hybrid routing protocol
      -  BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
         -  Determines route based on paths, network policies, or configured rule-sets

  #### 1.3.3.2 Routing types

  [Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/YRzr56cwgCg)

   - Routing
        -  Send IP packets across the network
           -  Forwarding decisions are based on destination IP address
        -  Each router only knows the next step
           -  The packet asks for directions every hop along the way
           -  The list of directions is held in a routing table


  - Static
    -  Administratively define the routes - You’re in control
    -  Advantages
       -  Easy to configure and manage on smaller networks
       -  No overhead from routing protocols (CPU, memory, bandwidth)
       -  Easy to configure on sub networks (only one way out)
       -  More secure - no routing protocols to analyze
    -  Disadvantages
       -  Difficult to administer on larger networks
       -  No automatic method to prevent routing loops
       -  If there’s a network change, you have to manually update the routes
       -  No automatic rerouting if an outage occurs

  - Dynamic
    -  Routers send routes to other routers
       -  Routing tables are updated in (almost) real-time
    -  Advantages
       -  No manual route calculations or management
       -  New routes are populated automatically
       -  Very scalable
    -  Disadvantages
       -  Some router overhead required
       -  Requires some initial configuration to work properly

  - Default
    -  A route when no other route matches
       -  The “gateway of last resort”
    -  A remote site may have only one route
       -  Go that way -> rest of the world
       -  If traffic comes from inside , it sends to out side vice versa
    -  Can dramatically simplify the routing process
       -  Works in conjunction with all other routing methods (instead of listing all external route, use default route)

 ### 1.3.4  IPv6 concepts
- Addressing
- Tunneling

  -  6 to4 addressing
     -  Send IPv6 over an existing IPv4 network
     -  Creates an IPv6 based on the IPv4 address
     -  Requires relay routers -
        -  IP protocol 41 - a transition technology
     -  No support for NAT
  -  4in6
     -  Tunnel IPv4 traffic on an IPv6 network

  - Teredo/Miredo
    -  Tunnel IPv6 through Network address translated (NATed) IPv4
       -  End-to-end IPv6 through an IPv4 network
       -  No special IPv6 router needed
       -  Temporary use
          -  We’ll have IPv6 native networks soon (?)
    -  Miredo - Open-source Teredo for Linux,
       -  BSD Unix, and Mac OS X
       -  Full functionality
- Dual stack
[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/NhRjwjt2Aog)
  -  Dual-stack IPv4 and IPv6
     -  Run both at the same time
     -  Interfaces will be assigned multiple address types
  -  IPv4
     -  Configured with IPv4 addresses
     -  Maintains an IPv4 routing table
     -  Uses IPv4 dynamic routing protocols
  -  IPv6
     -  Configured with IPv6 addresses
     -  Maintains a separate IPv6 routing table
     -  Uses IPv6 dynamic routing protocols

- Neighbor discovery Protocol (NDP)

  -  No broadcasts necessary for IPV4
     -  Operates using multicast (instead of broadcast) over ICMPv6
  -  Neighbor MAC Discovery
     -  Replaces the IPv4 ARP (which use broadcast)
  -  SLAAC (Stateless Address Auto-configuration)
     -  Automatically configure an IP address without a DHCP server
  -  DAD (Duplicate Address Detection)
     -  No duplicate IPs!
  -  Discover routers
     -  Router Solicitation (RS) and Router Advertisement (RA)

- Router advertisement
  -  ICMPv6 adds the Neighbor Discovery Protocol
     -  sends IPV6 multicast which is Router Solicitation (RS) to all the routers 
     -  Router then send back a unicast signal Router Advertisement (RA) advertising the MAC address of that local router. 
  -  Routers also send unsolicited RA messages
     -  From the multicast destination of ff02::1
  -  Transfers IPv6 address information, prefix value, and prefix length, etc.


  -  There’s no ARP in IPv6
     -  So how do you find out the MAC address of a device?
  -  Neighbor Solicitation (NS) / Neighbor Advertisement (NA)
     -  This is to one work station to find another (find the MAC address) 
     -  Sent as a multicast, saying I am trying to find the MAC address of this IPV6 address ; Neighbor Solicitation (NS)
     -  The workstation that owns that IP send back the MAC address which is Neighbor Advertisement (NA)

 ### 1.3.5 Performance concepts

[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/uEKDZqI5osA)
- Managing Network Traffic
  -  Many different devices
     -  Desktop, laptop, VoIP phone, mobile devices
  -  Many different applications
     -  Mission critical applications, streaming video,
streaming audio
  -  Different apps have different
network requirements
     -  Voice is real-time
     -  Recorded streaming video has a buffer
     -  Database application is interactive
  -  Some applications are “more important”
than others
     -  Voice traffic needs to have priority over YouTube

- Packet shaping /Traffic shaping
  -  Packet shaping, traffic shaping
  -  Control by bandwidth usage or data rates
  -  Set important applications to have higher priorities than other apps
- QoS (Quality of Service)
   -  Prioritize traffic performance
    -  Voice over IP traffic has priority over web-browsing
    -  Prioritize by maximum bandwidth, traffic rate, VLAN, etc.
  -  Quality of Service
     -  Describes the process of controlling traffic flows
  -  Many different methods - Across many different topologies

- Managing QoS
  -  CoS (Class of Service)
     -  OSI Layer 2
     -  Ethernet frame header in an 802.1q trunk
     -  Usually applied in the intranet (not from an ISP)
  -  Differentiated Services (DiffServ)
     -  OSI Layer 3
     -  QoS bits are enabled in the IPv4 header
     -  Bits are set external to the application
     -  Routers and switches have to play along
  -  DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point)
     -  DS (Differentiated Services) field in the IP header
 ### 1.3.6  NAT/PAT (Network Address Translation)

[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/JAYpfBvGVI8)

 - NAT (Network Address Translation)
    -  It is estimated that there are over 20 billion devices connected to the Internet (and growing) ,IPv4 supports around 4.29 billion addresses
    -  The address space for IPv4 is exhausted ,There are no available addresses to assign
    -  How does it all work?
       -  Network Address Translation
    -  This isn’t the only use of NAT
       -  NAT is handy in many situations
    -  Takes a private IP address and converts it for use on the internet. NAT provides security in that these UP addresses cannot be seen by external users. Multiple devices in the same private network can use the same, real IP address to transmit out onto the internet. 

  - NAT Overload / PAT
    - When you have multiple of PCs that inside your network that need to do NAT, its called NAT Overload / PAT Port Address Translation 
    - With overloading all inside hosts get translated to one single IP address. Port numbers help the router identify which host should receive the return traffic. 
    - Port numbers are at the Transport Layer to identify local hosts here. If we used IP addresses that would be called static. Theoretically, 65000 hosts with one real IP address.


 ### 1.3.7  Port forwarding

   -  24x7 access to a service hosted internally (from outside)
    -  Web server, gaming server, security system, etc.
  -  External IP/port number maps to an internal IP/port -  Does not have to be the same port number
     -  Also called Destination NAT or Static NAT
     -  Destination address is translated from a public IP to a private IP
  -  Does not expire or timeout
 ### 1.3.8  Access control list

 [Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/6Yj1-pZmHvY)

 - Packet filtering
    -  Access control list is a packet filter 
    -  Used to allow or deny traffic , Also used for NAT, QoS, etc.
    -  Defined on the ingress or egress of an interface , Incoming or outgoing
    -  ACLs can evaluate on certain criteria -  Source IP, Destination IP, TCP port numbers, UDP port numbers, ICMP
    -  Deny or permit
       -  What happens when an ACL matches the traffic?
    -  ACLs have evolved through the years
       -  More options and features available for traffic filtering
- Firewall rules
  -  Access control lists (ACLs) -  Allow or disallow traffic based on tuples (combination of variables)
  -  Groupings of categories -  Source IP, Destination IP, port number,
time of day, application, etc.
  -  A logical path -  Usually top-to-bottom
  -  Can be very general or very specific
     -  Specific rules are usually at the top
  -  Implicit deny (this is the default action)
     -  Most firewalls include a deny at the bottom
     -  Even if you didn’t put one

 ### 1.3.9  Distributed switching
[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/EdVOeGDYHCU?t=141)

   -  Remove the physical segmentation
     -  A virtual network distributed across
all physical platforms
  -  When a VM moves, the network doesn’t change
     -  Servers will always connect to the right VLAN
 ### 1.3.10  Packet-switched vs. circuit-switched network

 [Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/uBpacYBwYwM)

 - Circuit switching - Traditional Telephone service
    -  Circuit is established between endpoints before data passes -  Like a phone call
    -  Nobody else can use the circuit when it’s idle  -  Inefficient use of resources
    -  Connection is always there -  It’s mine. You can’t use it.
    -  Capacity is guaranteed -  You’d better use it, you paid for it.
    - Circuit switching methods
      -  POTS (plain old telephone service) and PSTN (public switched telephone network)
      -  T1 / E1 / T3 / E3
         -  Create a circuit between two sites
      -  ISDN
         -  Use a phone number to call another ISDN modem

- Packet switching
  -  Data is grouped into packets
     -  Voice, data, video, etc.
     -  Like a network
  -  The media is usually shared
     -  Someone else can use it, even when you don’t
  -  One connection may have more bandwidth
allocated than another
     -  How much money would you like to spend?

  - Packet switching Technologies 
    -  SONET, ATM
    -  DSL
    -  Frame relay
    -  MPLS
    -  Cable modem
    -  Satellite
    -  Wireless

 ### 1.3.11  Software-defined networking

  -  Networking devices have two functional planes of operation
     -  Control plane -  Data plane
  -  Directly programmable
    -  Configuration is different than forwarding
  -  Agile
    -  Changes can be made dynamically

  -  Centrally managed - Global view, single pane of glass
  -  Programmatically configured
   -  Orchestration - No human intervention
  -  Open standards / vendor neutral
    -  A standard interface to the network


## 1.4 Given a scenario, configure the appropriate IP addressing components.
[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/aEMtAFvouNU)
 -  Private vs. public

  - Private: 
    - Private IPv4 addresses are not unique and can be used by an internal network.
  Private Address Blocks are 10.0.0.0/8 or 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0/12 or
  172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255, 192.168.0.0/16 or 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255.
  - Public: 
    - Addresses which are globally routed between ISP routers but not all available
  IPv4 addresses can be used on the Internet.
 -  Loopback and reserved

     - The IP address range 127.0. 0.0 – 127.255. 255.255 is reserved for
loopback, i.e. a Host's self-address, also known as localhost address. 
     - Data sent on loopback is
forwarded by the operating system to a virtual network interface within the operating system.

  -  Reserved addresses
     -  Set aside for future use or testing
     -  240.0.0.1 through 254.255.255.254
 -  Default gateway

     -  The router that allows you to communicate
   outside of your local subnet
     -  The default gateway must be an IP address on the local subnet
 -  Virtual IP

     -  Not associated with a physical network adapter
     -  Virtual machine, internal router address
 -  Subnet mask

     -  Used by the local device to determine what subnet it’s on 
     -  The subnet mask isn’t (usually) transmitted
across the network
 -  Subnetting
     - Classful
[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/GxE395bCANM)
       -  Very specific subnetting architecture
       -  Not used since 1993
       -  But still referenced in casual conversation
       -  Used as a starting point when subnetting
       -  Standard values
       - Classes A, B, C, D, and E

         1. Class A: Ranges from 0.0.0.0/8 to 127.0.0.0/8, designed to support
         extremely large networks with more than 16 million host addresses.
         1. Class B: Ranges from 128.0.0.0/16 to 191.255.0.0, designed to support
         the needs of moderate to large size networks with up to approximately
         65,000 host addresses.
         1. Class C: Ranges from 192.0.0.0/24 to 223.255.255.0/24, designed to
         support small networks with a maximum of 254 hosts.
      - Classless
  [Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/L3dsWxn5RBU)
        - VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask): Allows a network space to be divided into
unequal parts.
        - CIDR notation (IPv4 vs. IPv6) [Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/8IqXQ88QXfc)


           - (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation (IPv4 vs. IPv6): Is a way to allow
more flexible allocation of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses than was possible
with the original system of IP address classes.
 -  Address assignments
- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): Centralizes management of IP addressing
in a network by allowing a server to dynamically assign IP addresses to clients
- DHCPv6 (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Version 6): It is the IPv6 equivalent of the
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.
- Static IP addressing is the standard in small-to-large networks when configuring client
computers.
- APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing): Feature of Windows that automatically assigns
an IP address to the system when the client cannot obtain an IP address automatically.
- EUI64 (Extended Unique Identifier-64): The IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers) standard defining 64-bit physical addresses. In the EUI-64 scheme, the OUI
portion of an address is 24 bits in length. A 40-bit extension identifier makes up the rest
of the physical address, for a total of 64 bits.
- IP reservations A rule on the DHCP server called a DHCP reservation can tie the client's
MAC address to a particular IP address.

       -  80 MHz required for 802.11ac stations
       -  160 MHz optional (contiguous channels
     or non-contiguous bonded channels)
### 1.6.6  Channel bonding
- “With channel bonding, you can use two channels at the same time. As you might guess, the ability to use two channels at once increases performance. Bonding can help increase wireless transmission rates from the 54 Mbps offered with the 802.11g standards to a theoretical maximum of 600 Mbps with 802.11n. 802.11n uses the OFDM transmission strategy.”

### 1.8.1  DNS service

[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/VqQQMXNhZBM)
- An Overview of DNS
    -  Translates human-readable names
  into computer-readable IP addresses
      -  You only need to remember www.github.com
    -  Hierarchical
       -  Follow the path to find the server 

    -  Distributed database
       -  Many DNS servers
       -  13 root server clusters
       -  Hundreds of generic top-level domains (gTLDs) - .com, .org, .net, etc.
       -  Over 275 country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) - .us, .ca, .uk, etc.

  - Internal vs. External DNS
    -  Internal DNS - Managed on internal servers
       -  Configured and maintained by the local team
       -  Contains DNS information about internal devices
       -  DNS service on Windows Server
    -  External DNS - Managed by a third-party
       -  Does not have internal device information
       -  Google DNS, Quad9

  - Third-party DNS
    -  Managing Internal DNS can be challenging Especially in large environments
    -  Outsource the (Internal) DNS
       -  Cloud-based DNS services
    -  Features not available on a privately-hosted DNS server
       -  High-availability, low latency, and scaling options
- Record types
[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/D37RhTJ0ALY)
  - Resource Records (RR)
    -  The database records of domain name services
    -  Over 30 record types - IP addresses, certificates, host alias names, etc.
  - Address Records (A) (AAAA)
    -  Defines the IP address of a host
       -  This is the most popular query
    -  A records are for IPv4 addresses
       -  Modify the A record to change the host name to IP address resolution
    -  AAAA records are for IPv6 addresses
       -  The same DNS server, different records

  - Canonical name records (CNAME)
    -  A name is an alias of another, canonical name
       -  One physical server, multiple services
       -  
          `- gopher IN CNAME mail.mydomain.name.
          ftp IN CNAME mail.mydomain.name.
          www IN CNAME mail.mydomain.name.`
  - Service records (SRV)
    -  Find a specific service
    -  Where is the Windows Domain Controller? Where is the instant messaging server? Where is the VoIP controller?
  - Mail exchanger record (MX)
    -  Determines the host name for the mail server - this isn’t an IP address; it’s a name

  - Name server records (NS)
    -  List the name servers for a domain - NS records point to the name of the server

  - Pointer record (PTR)
    -  The reverse of an A or AAAA record
    -  Added to a reverse map zone file

  - Text records (TXT)
    -  Human-readable text information
       -  Useful public information
    -  SPF protocol (Sender Policy Framework)
       -  Prevent mail spoofing
       -  Mail servers check that incoming mail
     really did come from an authorized host

    -  DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail)
       -  Digitally sign your outgoing mail
       -  Validated by the mail server,
     not usually seen by the end user
       -  Put your public key in the DKIM TXT record


- Forward vs. reverse zone
  - Forward Lookup
    - When a DNS query comes from the client, DNS server works by looking up the hostname string value on column “Name” then returns the IP address value on column “Data” as the answer to the query.DNS server stores record containing a hostname string value under column “Name” along with its associated IP address value under column “Data“. 
  - Reverse Lookup
    - To find out the hostname based on the IP address, limitation by design that DNS server cannot just lookup at the value on “Data” column to find the associated “Name” value. For this purpose, another record should be created in the table where IP address value is stored under “Name” column and the hostname string is stored under “Data” column. 


### 1.8.2  DHCP service
[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/uLJpp8HFNBc)
- DHCP
  -  IP address configuration used to be manual
     -  IP address, subnet mask, gateway,
DNS servers, NTP servers, etc.
  -  October 1993 - The bootstrap protocol - BOOTP
  -  BOOTP didn’t automatically define everything
     -  Some manual configurations were still required
     -  BOOTP also didn’t know when an IP address might be available again
  -  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
     -  Initially released in 1997
     -  Updated through the years

- Managing DHCP in the enterprise
  -  Limited Communication range
  -  Uses the IPv4 broadcast domain
  -  Stops at a router
  -  Multiple servers needed for redundancy
  -  Across different locations
  -  Scalability is always an issue
  -  May not want (or need) to manage
DHCP servers at every remote location
  -  You’re going to need a little help(er)
  -  Send DHCP request across broadcast domains

- DHCP process
  -  Step 1: Discover - Client to DHCP Server
     
     -  it broadcasts a special packet that looks for a DHCP server. This packet is known as the DHCPDISCOVER packet. This broadcast msg dont go any further than the router.
     -  Find all of the available DHCP Server (port 68 to 67)


  -  Step 2: Offer - DHCP Server to client
     -  Send some IP address options to the client
     -  “server, which is always on the lookout for DHCPDISCOVER broadcasts, picks up the packet and compares the request with the scopes it has defined. If it finds that it has a scope for the network from which the packet originated, it chooses an address from the scope, reserves it, and sends the address, along with any other information, such as the lease duration, to the client. This is known as the DHCPOFFER packet.” (67 to 68)
     -  “Because the client still does not have an IP address, this communication is also achieved via broadcast. By default, DHCP operates on ports 67 and 68.”
 
 
  -  Step 3: Request - Client to DHCP Server
     -  Client chooses an offer and makes a formal request (68 to 67)
     -  “client notifies the server that the offer has been accepted, through a packet called a DHCPREQUEST packet.”
 
  -  Step 4: Acknowledgment - DHCP Server to client 
     -  DHCP server sends an acknowledgment to the client  (67 to 68)
     -  “server finalizes the offer and sends the client an acknowledgment. This last message, which is sent as a broadcast, is known as a DHCPACK packet. After the client system receives the DHCPACK, it initializes the TCP/IP suite and can communicate on the network.”

  -  A scope is generally a single contiguous pool of IP addresses
  -  DHCP exceptions can be made inside of the scope

- DHCP address allocation
  -  T1 timer
  -  Check in with the lending DHCP server
to renew the IP address
  -  50% of the lease time (by default)
  -  T2 timer
  -  If the original DHCP server is down,
try rebinding with any DHCP server
  -  87.5% of the lease time (7/8ths)

- DHCP address allocation
  -  Dynamic allocation
  -  DHCP server has a big pool of addresses to give out
  -  Addresses are reclaimed after a lease period
  -  Automatic allocation
  -  Similar to dynamic allocation
  -  DHCP server keeps a list of past assignments
  -  You’ll always get the same IP address
  -  Static allocation
  -  Administratively configured table of MAC addresses
  -  Each MAC address has a matching IP address
  -  Other names - Static DHCP Assignment, Static DHCP,
Address Reservation, IP Reservation


- MAC reservations

  -  Log files, authentication information, outage details
  -  Automatic updates
  -  No flashing 12:00 lights
  -  Flexible
  -  You control how clocks are updated
  -  Very accurate
  -  Accuracy is better than 1 millisecond on a local network
- NTP clients and servers
  -  NTP server
  -  Respond to time requests from NTP clients
  -  Does not modify their own time
  -  NTP client
  -  Requests time updates from NTP server
  -  NTP client/server
  -  Requests time updates from an NTP server
  -  Responds to time requests from other NTP clients
  -  Important to plan your NTP strategy
  -  Which devices are clients, servers, and client/servers?

- NTP stratum layers
  -  Some clocks are better than others
  -  Your distance from the original reference clock
is a stratum
  -  Stratum 0
  -  Atomic clock, GPS clock
  -  Very accurate
  -  Stratum 1
  -  Synchronized to stratum 0 servers
  -  Primary time servers
  -  Stratum 2
  -  Sync’d to stratum 1 servers
- Configuring NTP
  -  NTP client
  -  Specify the NTP server address (IP or hostname)
  -  Use multiple NTP servers (if available) for redundancy
  -  NTP server
  -  You need at least one clock source
  -  Specify the stratum level of the clock
  -  If there’s a choice, the lower stratum level wins
