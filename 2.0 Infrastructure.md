## 2.1 Given a scenario, deploy the appropriate cabling solution.

### 2.1.1 Media types
- Copper

[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/v9m6uBaKD2s)
  - Twisted pair copper cabling
     -  Balanced pair operation
     -  Two wires with equal and opposite signals
     -  Transmit+, Transmit- / Receive+, Receive-
     -  The twist keeps a single wire constantly moving away
    from the interference
     -  The opposite signals are compared on the other end
     -  Pairs in the same cable have different twist rates
  - UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair): 
    - A type of copper twisted pair cabling that does
  not include shielding around its conductors.
  - STP (Shielded Twisted Pair): 
    - A type of cable containing twisted-wire pairs that
  are not only individually insulated, but also surrounded by a shielding made of a
  metallic substance such as foil.
    - Requires the cable to be grounded
    -  Abbreviations
        -  U = Unshielded, S = Braided shielding, F = Foil shielding
        -  (Overall cable) / (individual pairs)TP
        -  Braided shielding around the entire cable
       and foil around the pairs is S/FTP
        -  Foil around the cable and no shielding around
       the pairs is F/UTP
  - Coaxial : 
    - Insulated copper wire; used to carry high-speed data traffic and
  television signals.
     -  Two or more forms (insulator?) share a common axis
     -  RG-6 used in television/digital cable And high-speed Internet over cable
     -  RG-59 used as patch cables Not designed for long distances
- Fiber
  - Type of cabling that uses light transmissions instead of electric pulses making
  threats such as EMI, crosstalk and attenuation non-issues. 

  - Well-suited for high-speed data communications and expensive too.
  - Single-mode - 
      - A type of fiber optic cable that uses a single direct beam of light,
  thus allowing for greater distance and increased transfer speeds.
  - Multimode 
      - A type of fiber optic cable that carries multiple beams of light
  through the cable, bouncing off the cable walls. 
      - This strategy actually weakens
  the signal, reducing the length and speed at which the data signal can travel.
### 2.1.2 Plenum vs. PVC
[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/v9m6uBaKD2s?t=462)
  - Plenum: Is made of Teflon or FEP which gives off much less poisonous gas than PVC
  when it burns. Also suffer from less attenuation than the PVC cabling.

   -  Combine four SFPs into a single transceiver , Cost savings in fiber and equipment
   -  Bi-Directional (BiDi) QSFP and QSFP+ , Additional efficiency over a single fiber run

- Satellite
  - Satellite communication relies on line of sight transmission and is subject to
physical obstructions like thick storm clouds. It also has higher latency than other WAN
technologies since the signal is transmitted thousands of miles to the satellite then
thousands of miles back down.
- Copper
  - Is a popular handoff from the provider when the network equipment is within
100 meters or less from the provider's termination point. The various services that
copper is used with include leased lines, T1/T3 local loop, broadband cable, DSL, and dialup.

- Fiber
  - A cable that transmits data at close to the speed of light along glass or plastic
fibers.
 - Large installation in the WAN core, SONET, wavelength division multiplexing
- Wireless
  - A form of computer networking or other communication that uses radio
signals and microwaves to transmit data

### 2.5.3 Characteristics of service
[Professor Messer](https://youtu.be/byENdIkwBpA)
- MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching): 
  - A network technology defined by a set of IETF
specifications that enable Layer 3 devices, such as routers, to establish and manage
network traffic.
- ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode): 
  - A cell-switching network technology designed for
the high-speed transfer of voice, video, and data in LANs, WANs, and telephone
networks.
  - common protocol transport over SONET
- Frame relay
  - A WAN protocol that operates at the Physical and Data Link layers of the
OSI model.
  - Lan traffic is encapsulated in to frame relay frames
  - Replaced by MPLS
- PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet): 
  - A protocol used to connect multiple
network users on an Ethernet local area network to a remote site through a common
device.
- PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol): 
  - A protocol that works on the Data Link layer of the TCP/IP
protocol suite, PPP is used to send IP datagrams over serial point-to-point links. PPP can
be used in synchronous and asynchronous connections and can dynamically configure
and test remote network connections.
- DMVPN (Dynamic Multipoint Virtual Private Network): 
  - Is a protocol that dynamically
builds Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) VPN connections between branch offices.
- SIP trunk (Session Initiation Protocol): 
  - Is a trunk purchased from a SIP provider for
connecting VoIP PBXs calls. The SIP trunk is an IP version of a leased line for a PBX, since
it allows for connectivity to the PSTN for VoIP.
### 2.5.4 Termination

- Demarcation point (Demarc): 
  - The point of division between a telecommunications
service carrier's network and a building's internal network.
- CSU (Channel Service Unit) /DSU (Data Service Unit): 
  - A combination of two WAN
connectivity devices on a Frame Relay network that work together to connect a digital
WAN line with a customer's LAN.
  - sits between the router and the circuit, CSU connects to the network provider 
  - DSU connects to the data terminal equipment (DTE) , usually a router
  - Sometimes CSU/DSU a physical device, sometime its built in to a router


- Smart jack AKA Network interface unit (NIU)
  - A termination for T-carrier wire pairs that is located at the customer demark
and which functions as a connection protection and monitoring point.
